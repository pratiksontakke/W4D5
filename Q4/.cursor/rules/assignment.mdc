## Statement: Intelligent Document Chunking for Enterprise Knowledge Management System

An enterprise software company's knowledge base contains diverse content types—technical docs, support tickets, API references, policies, and tutorials. Current uniform chunking breaks code snippets, separates troubleshooting steps, and disconnects policy requirements, causing poor retrieval accuracy.

**Challenge**: Build an adaptive chunking system that automatically detects document types and applies appropriate chunking strategies (semantic, code-aware, hierarchical) to improve knowledge retrieval for internal teams and support automation.

**Solution Approach**
- **Document Classification**: Auto-detect content types and structure patterns
- **Adaptive Chunking**: Apply document-specific strategies for optimal context preservation
- **LangChain Integration**: Orchestrate processing pipeline and vector store updates
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track retrieval accuracy and refine strategies

**Key Inputs**
- Mixed enterprise documents (Confluence, Jira, GitHub wikis, PDFs)
- Document metadata and usage patterns
- User query success metrics

**Expected Output**
- Optimally chunked document collections
- Improved retrieval accuracy metrics
- Automated processing pipeline for new content

**Submission**
- **GitHub Repository**: Complete implementation with evaluation metrics
