### Content Type Classifier
**Core Principle:** Automated identification of document types and their structural characteristics.
**Specific Logic:** Uses natural language processing and pattern recognition to analyze document features (headers, code blocks, lists) and classify content into predefined categories.
**Common Tooling:** scikit-learn, spaCy, transformers (BERT/RoBERTa)
**Project Motto:** "Master document DNA through intelligent pattern recognition."

### Semantic Boundary Detection
**Core Principle:** Identifying meaningful content boundaries while preserving context and relationships.
**Specific Logic:** Combines linguistic analysis, semantic similarity metrics, and structural cues to determine optimal chunk boundaries that maintain coherent information units.
**Common Tooling:** sentence-transformers, LangChain, NLTK
**Project Motto:** "Slice with precision, preserve with intelligence."

### Context Window Management
**Core Principle:** Dynamic management of context windows to maintain information coherence across chunks.
**Specific Logic:** Implements sliding window approach with overlap, using semantic similarity and reference tracking to maintain contextual links between related chunks.
**Common Tooling:** numpy, PyTorch, transformers
**Project Motto:** "Context is king, relationships are gold."

### Vector Store Integration
**Core Principle:** Efficient storage and retrieval of document chunks using vector embeddings.
**Specific Logic:** Converts text chunks into high-dimensional vectors, indexes them for similarity search, and implements efficient nearest neighbor search algorithms.
**Common Tooling:** FAISS, Annoy, Milvus, Pinecone
**Project Motto:** "Transform text into traversable space."

### Relationship Graph Storage
**Core Principle:** Maintaining and querying complex relationships between document chunks.
**Specific Logic:** Implements a graph database structure to store chunk relationships, with edges representing semantic or structural connections and weights indicating relationship strength.
**Common Tooling:** Neo4j, NetworkX, DGL
**Project Motto:** "Connect the dots, reveal the story."

### Strategy Optimization Engine
**Core Principle:** Continuous improvement of chunking strategies based on performance metrics and user feedback.
**Specific Logic:** Implements reinforcement learning approach to adjust chunking parameters and selection of strategies based on success metrics and user interaction patterns.
**Common Tooling:** Ray, Optuna, PyTorch
**Project Motto:** "Learn from experience, adapt for excellence."

### Query Processing Engine
**Core Principle:** Intelligent query analysis and multi-stage retrieval process.
**Specific Logic:** Combines vector similarity search with graph traversal to retrieve relevant chunks and their related context, using ranking algorithms to prioritize results.
**Common Tooling:** Elasticsearch, LangChain, RankLib
**Project Motto:** "Understand the question, connect the answers."
