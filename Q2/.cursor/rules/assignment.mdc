# Indian Legal Document Search System

Build a search system for Indian legal documents that compares 4 different similarity methods to find the most effective approach for legal document retrieval.

### Technical Requirements:

### 1. Implement at least 4 Similarity Methods:
- **Cosine Similarity:** Standard semantic matching
- **Euclidean Distance:** Geometric distance in embedding space
- **MMR:** Reduce redundancy in results
- **Hybrid Similarity:** 0.6×Cosine + 0.4×Legal_Entity_Match

### 2. Test Dataset:
- Indian Income Tax Act sections
- GST Act provisions
- Sample court judgments
- Property law documents

### 3. Comparison Framework:
- **Precision:** Relevant docs in top 5 results
- **Recall:** Coverage of relevant documents
- **Diversity Score:** Result variety (for MMR evaluation)
- **Side-by-side UI:** Show all 4 method results simultaneously

### 4. Web UI Interface:
- Document upload (PDF/Word)
- Text query input
- 4-column results comparison
- Performance metrics dashboard

### Test Queries:
1. "Income tax deduction for education"
2. "GST rate for textile products"
3. "Property registration process"
4. "Court fee structure"

### Deliverables:
- Submit Github URL with
  - Working code
  - **UI:** Web app with comparison
  - **Analysis:** Performance report with recommendations # Indian Legal Document Search System
