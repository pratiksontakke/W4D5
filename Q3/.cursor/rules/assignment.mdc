# Fine-Tuned Embeddings for Sales Conversion Prediction

Sales teams struggle to accurately predict customer conversion likelihood from call transcripts, relying on subjective human judgment that leads to inconsistent predictions and missed opportunities. Generic embeddings fail to capture domain-specific sales nuances like buying signals, objection patterns, and conversation dynamics critical for accurate conversion assessment.

**Challenge**: Build an AI system that fine-tunes embeddings specifically for sales conversations to improve conversion prediction accuracy and enable better customer prioritization.

**Solution Approach**
- **Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune pre-trained embeddings on sales conversation data with conversion labels to capture sales-specific semantic patterns
- **Contrastive Learning**: Train embeddings to distinguish between high-conversion and low-conversion conversation patterns
- **LangChain Framework**: Orchestrate the fine-tuning pipeline, embedding generation, and similarity-based prediction workflow
- **Evaluation Pipeline**: Compare fine-tuned vs. generic embeddings on conversion prediction tasks

**Key Inputs**
- Call transcripts with conversion outcomes (successful/failed sales)
- Historical sales interaction data
- Customer context and interaction metadata
- Pre-trained embedding models for fine-tuning

**Expected Output**
- Fine-tuned embedding model optimized for sales conversations
- Conversion probability scores with improved accuracy
- Performance comparison metrics (fine-tuned vs. generic embeddings)
- Deployment-ready prediction system

**Submission**
- **GitHub Repository**: Complete fine-tuning implementation with evaluation metrics # Fine-Tuned Embeddings for Sales Conversion Prediction
